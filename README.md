# Statistical-tests-in-C
The following is implementation of z-test , t-test and linear regression in C
The mntfinal.c file makes use of file handling while the other file makes use of your system resources that is the entire code and the data is stroed in the file itself.
I used Pelles IDE to compile and execute the complete program.
The program has been created, compiled by me and I am the sole creator of it.
